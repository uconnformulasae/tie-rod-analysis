# tie-rod-analysis

This project is designed to analyze data from tie rod strain gauges. The primary goal is to identify and visualize key metrics such as maximum and minimum force events, as well as correlations between different data points. The analysis includes plotting force and lateral acceleration over time, providing insights into the performance and behavior of the tie rods under various conditions
